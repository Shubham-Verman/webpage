# webpage
(I guess 3/4 days lngyge if ideas and content proper honge academic and note wale ke liye)
(Also mobile ka navigation set up ho jaye toh)


## Progress
- All pages working fine

  
## To-Do
- Academic section need to setup with the content in it.
- Mobile version need to set up.
- Mobile version is present in pc in website folder; note : backup folder in website folder
- is actually this same backup which is here in git and was online
- Notes section also have to setup for mobile version.
- notes section desktop version can be made more appealing also
- content for notes section also need to be setup.
- content for blog section also have to setup.
- Baaki chut put changes like good photos and proper spacing vgra to look good.


## Academic Section ideas:
- Many ideas ; one is set up 2 section side by side or scrollable for Research and CV
- With also downloadable links.
- CV as story with string like timeline or may be not.
- Research highlight as flashcard summary of each thing (more appealing i guess)
- or simply note k jaise boxes and summary.
- similaryly for talk, presentation, prizes, conferences , etc.


## Mobile version updates:
- Home screen content done.
- Contact screen done
- Blog screen done.
- Navigation Bar was NOT working properly in mobile.
- Academic page NOT setup bcoz even desktop version is NOT set up.
- Notes Section also not setup in mobile version.


## Issues
- Navigation bar was giving hard time in mobile version.


## Enchancements
- SEO ka pta krke google mein direct search se reach bda skte ( but is it really necesaary? idk)
- google analytics se link krke check kr skte kitne views aa rhe hai ( but i guess isse tode hacking prone bhi ho skte)
- apna custmosise domain le skte hai ( but paise lygya and hack hone se bchane ke liye dekhna pdyga)


###RECALL:::

## Github files: webpage (this is desktop version only)
- open these files or just publish to recall how these working 
- summary interface works perfect for all pages just content need to add and academic(notes) section need to figure out.
- BACKUP 2 in github is just previous version of backup with only the navigation bar interface. ( not any important bcoz webpage version is stable and working perfect)

## PC: Drive E / Website folder
- Folder backup : these have same files as backup of webpage github files.
- Website folder: these have the files on which I was working on 18/01/2025 to make the website mobile friendly;
- html files sbhi same hai ; just mobile-styles.css add kra 1 line in html files other than that nothing changed in html files; so agr sirf yeh line uda dete hai toh website is exactly same as github files
- mobile-styles.css file bnaya tha to make mobile friendly; jisse contact , blog(not sure of cover photo), home(perfect) and footer chl rha hai.
- Academic , notes ke liye nhi bnaya hai abhi;
- navigation bar ke liye bnaya tha pr problem de rha tha toh delete kr diya: toh yek trh se woh bhi nhi h bnya hai
